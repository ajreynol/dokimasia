# anakrisis

*What does this pull request do to cvc5's proof-completeness inventory — and is
that worth a maintainer's time?*

**Internal.** A research project under
[anoieu's research-project rules](https://github.com/ajreynol/anoieu/blob/main/docs/policy.md),
not a project announcement. It is not linked from the root
[`README`](../../README.md), from [`docs/README.md`](../../docs/README.md), or
from either register ([`TODO.md`](../../TODO.md),
[`docs/issues.md`](../../docs/issues.md)), and it should stay that way until
there is something to show. `ajreynol/dokimasia` is a **public** remote:
unadvertised means *not pointed at*, not *not visible*. **Nothing here is
dokimasia's opinion of anybody's pull request**, and no review written here has
been sent to anyone.

**An island in this repository.** anakrisis runs dokimasia's analyses as a
subprocess against two trees and diffs the results; it reads cvc5's tree and its
own ledger. Nothing in `dokimasia/` imports it, no test covers it, no baseline
ratchets it, no CI job runs it, and its one script is invoked by hand from
somebody else's checkout. Delete this directory and the repository is exactly as
functional — that is the property that makes it safe to keep here.

**Where "read-only" stops, stated rather than assumed.** Two places, both
narrow. *Inside this repository* it writes only within `tools/anakrisis/`, and
it never writes a baseline: the delta is computed by running the analyses at two
commits and comparing the two runs, so nothing it does can move a number the
parent ratchets. *Outside* it, in the cvc5 checkout it is run from, it adds a
detached `git worktree` at the merge base and removes it again — a read of an
old commit that git happens to spell as a directory. It does not check anything
out in the tree you are on, and it refuses to run at all if that tree is dirty.
If either of those ever stops being true, this paragraph is the thing that was
wrong.

## On the name

**ἀνάκρισις** — the preliminary examination in Athenian law. Before a case came
to trial the magistrate held an *anakrisis*: both parties were questioned, the
documents and depositions each meant to rely on were produced and sealed in the
ἐχῖνος, and **nothing that had not been put in at the anakrisis could be
produced at the trial**. It did not decide the case. It decided what the case
was, and what the court would be allowed to see.

Both halves are this project. It examines a change **before** it is admitted and
it **does not rule** — merging is a maintainer's, exactly as sending is under
[`pr-policy.md`](../../docs/pr-policy.md). And the sealed jar is the discipline
this project most needs: a review may rely only on what it recorded at review
time, which is the parent's **run-it** applied to a review rather than to a
finding.

It also pairs with the parent, which is why it belongs here and not somewhere
else. δοκιμασία is the scrutiny of the officer **before office**; ἀνάκρισις is
the examination of the case **before trial**. The parent asks whether the code
already in the tree is fit to serve. This asks the same question of the change
that is asking to come in.

*The alternative with a real argument behind it was* **κρίσις** *— the judgement
itself. It is the wrong word for the same reason it is the tempting one: this
project produces no judgement, and a name promising one would have to be
explained away on its first page. A name whose explanation needs a
qualification is a scope that has not been decided.* ἐπίκρισις *reads better
still and is taken elsewhere in the ecosystem.*

## The charter

**The question.** cvc5 takes pull requests against `main` continuously, and
reviewing them is one of the most expensive standing jobs its maintainers have.
Almost none of those changes are *about* proofs, and yet any of them can add a
path that produces no proof — a new inference with no reconstruction, a rule the
Eunoia seam cannot print, an option default that safe mode does not disable.
**Can a reviewer say what a change does to that inventory before it lands, and
would a maintainer rather have that than not?**

**The baseline is a tool that already exists, and it is what this has to beat.**
[`scripts/prompts/check_cvc5_issue`](../../scripts/prompts/check_cvc5_issue) is
prompt-based tooling with no instrument in it at all: it hands an assistant a
prompt and a cvc5 checkout, and it gets useful work out of the arrangement. A
review of a pull request can be had the same way, today, for one command. So
the question is **not** whether an assistant can review a change — that is
settled, and the answer is yes. It is whether **the computed delta adds
anything**, and the only honest way to find out is to run both arms on the same
change and compare. `run_anakrisis --baseline` is that control: the same prompt
with the delta withheld, differing from the real one by the delta and by nothing
else.

**What makes it answerable here and nowhere else.** dokimasia already computes
the inventory from a checkout, with no build, in about a second. Running it
twice — at the merge base and at the head — and subtracting is the whole
mechanism. The result is a claim about a change that nobody else is in a
position to make, and it is **cheap-to-refute** by construction: it is two
commands and a diff, and anybody can run them.

**The goals, in order.**

0. **The delta.** Run the parent's analyses at the merge base and at the head,
   and report what the change did to the inventory. Numbered zero because it is
   mechanical: it is computed rather than judged, and an assistant reads it
   rather than producing it. **Most pull requests will have an empty delta**,
   and that is the expected result rather than a failed run.
1. **Review one pull request end to end.** The delta, plus a reading of the diff
   scoped to what this repository has evidence about, written into the ledger in
   a shape a maintainer could act on. A review nobody could act on is an
   opinion.
2. **Record what the maintainers actually did.** Merged as proposed, merged with
   changes, changed for a reason we did not see, closed. The delta between our
   review and the outcome is the whole asset; everything else is bookkeeping.
3. **Beat the baseline, or say that it was not beaten.** For each pull request
   worked, run both arms and compare: which review lines were acted on, which
   were noise, and whether any of the difference came from the delta. The
   honest expected answer is *the computed half was worth it and the read was
   not* — and *neither arm was worth it* is an equally publishable result and
   the one that would retire this project.
4. **Say whether the empty delta is trustworthy.** A tool whose commonest output
   is *nothing to say* is only useful if that output can be relied on, and
   today it cannot be: see the two limits below.

**The wishue** — the goal if this went unusually well, and not a commitment.
The delta stops being something a person carries and becomes a check cvc5 runs
itself, on every pull request, in its own CI. That is **R11** in the parent's
[register of asks](../../docs/issues.md#open--asks), which the parent's
[`TODO.md`](../../TODO.md) currently declines to build a machine format for
until somebody asks for exactly this. It is also the shortest route to the thing
anoieu's report card says this repository is short of: its consumers today are
people, and a CI job is not a person.

**Out of scope**, explicitly, because a research project with no boundary
becomes a second tool:

- **General code review.** Not style, not naming, not performance, not
  architecture. cvc5's own reviewers and CI do all of that better, and an
  unsolicited opinion on somebody's variable names spends the parent's
  credibility on work that has earned none. The read half is scoped to what
  this repository has measured: the [hygiene rules](../../docs/hygiene.md), the
  [contract](../../docs/contract.md), and whatever the delta pointed at.
- **Reviewing pull requests we have nothing to say about.** The instrument
  speaks when it has something to say. *Nothing to say* is a complete outcome
  and is not written up anywhere but the ledger.
- **Sending anything.** No comment, no review, no approval, no push, no
  tracker call — ever. The artifact is a file in this directory and a person
  decides what, if anything, becomes of it.
- **Deciding whether a pull request should be merged.** The examination is not
  the trial. Nothing here carries a verdict on somebody's change.
- **Proof-completeness *findings*.** If a review turns up a hole rather than a
  question about a change, it leaves here and enters the parent's register at
  [`docs/issues.md`](../../docs/issues.md), where it is held to the parent's
  bar like anything else.
- **Speaking for dokimasia.** Nothing here is the parent's position.

**Is there a paper in it?** No, and probably not ever. The mechanism is a
subtraction between two runs of somebody else's tool, and the interesting part
would be goal 3 — what a review has to carry to be wanted — which is a fact
about one project's maintainers rather than a result. If that turns out to
generalise, the place for it is the parent's
[`postmortem.md`](../../docs/postmortem.md), not a `report/`.

## The two limits, named before the first use

Both were found by running the thing, and both bound what an empty delta means.

**It sees only what the parent prints.** `dokimasia report` is prose written
for a reader: it summarises, it truncates lists, and it names a count where the
count is the point. Anything it does not print is invisible here, so **an empty
delta is not a clean bill of health** — it is a statement about what two runs of
one program printed. This is the parent's standing warning applied to the child,
and it is also the argument for the wishue: a machine format would make the
subtraction exact, and until there is one the delta is a diff of prose.

**It is static, and it reads `src/` only.** No build, no run, no benchmark. A
change whose entire effect is at runtime shows nothing here, and the parent's
own record is that a static argument reading correctly is worth very little
until something has been run — three of them read correctly and were false, as
[`pr-policy.md`](../../docs/pr-policy.md#why-the-bar-names-execution) records.
A delta is evidence that something moved, never evidence about what it does.

## The PR policy is the parent's

**anakrisis posts nothing to cvc5. It has no separate channel and no lighter
standard than dokimasia.** [`docs/pr-policy.md`](../../docs/pr-policy.md)
governs here unchanged; this section says only how it lands on a project whose
whole output looks like something you would paste into a review box.

- **The act stays with a person**, and the temptation is at its worst here. A
  finished review is one copy-paste from being delivered, and delivering it
  would put an unrequested opinion under a maintainer's nose with this
  repository's name on it. Approval to *write* a review is not approval to
  *send* one.
- **The verdict is this project's.** Applying
  [the bar](../../docs/pr-policy.md#the-bar) to a review rather than to a
  finding: **theirs-not-ours** means a delta caused by our own parser is fixed
  here and never mentioned to anybody; **worth-the-attention** is the rule that
  will fail most often, and failing it is the correct outcome for most pull
  requests.
- **The guidance stays with the maintainer**, including this charter. A
  research project is started and ended by a person, and its scope changes the
  same way.

The [research-project rules](https://github.com/ajreynol/anoieu/blob/main/docs/policy.md)
say the same from the other side: nothing leaves the island by machine, a
research project has no separate channel and no lighter standard than its host,
and what it may do on its own is accumulate a ledger inside its own directory.

**On reading the tracker.** The script makes no network calls. It requires the
pull request to be checked out already, and prints the one command that does
that rather than running it — fetching is the person's, or an assistant's in a
session a person started, exactly as the parent arranges everything else that
touches the outside world.

## What it inherits from dokimasia, and where

A research project runs inside a working tool's repository because that tool has
evidence, and it is required to cite what it takes, so a reader can tell what
was checked from what was reasoned.

| inherited | where it was established |
| --- | --- |
| the inventory the delta is a delta of — trust ids, unreconstructed inferences, seam refusals, the checker's surface | [`docs/checks.md`](../../docs/checks.md), and the baselines beside `tests/` |
| that a quiet run is a fact about the check and not about cvc5 | [`README.md`](../../README.md), first blockquote |
| that a claim about behaviour is worthless until something has been run | [`docs/pr-policy.md`](../../docs/pr-policy.md#why-the-bar-names-execution) — three static arguments that read correctly and were false |
| what a proof-hygiene defect looks like, so the read half has a list rather than a hunch | [`docs/hygiene.md`](../../docs/hygiene.md) |
| what cvc5 actually promises, so a review can tell a violated promise from a disliked design | [`docs/contract.md`](../../docs/contract.md) |
| the `TRIAGE:` / `HUMAN RESPONSE:` frame, and that only an artifact settles anything | [`docs/workflows.md`](../../docs/workflows.md), [`docs/findings.md`](../../docs/findings.md) |
| running an assistant against a cvc5 checkout without touching anything outside it | [`scripts/prompts/check_cvc5_issue`](../../scripts/prompts/check_cvc5_issue), [`../empeiria/README.md`](../empeiria/README.md) |
| **the baseline this project has to beat** — that prompt-based tooling with no instrument already produces useful work | [`scripts/prompts/check_cvc5_issue`](../../scripts/prompts/check_cvc5_issue), which is the same job with the delta subtracted out |

The reason this is a child of dokimasia rather than its own repository is the
first row: without the inventory there is no delta, and without the delta this
is a general-purpose reviewer with no instrument and nothing to distinguish it.

## Using it

```bash
cd ~/cvc5
gh pr checkout 12893                  # the person's, or an assistant's: a network call
run_anakrisis 12893 --delta           # the inventory delta alone; no assistant
run_anakrisis 12893                   # the delta, then a review by an assistant
run_anakrisis 12893 --baseline        # the same review, delta withheld: the control
run_anakrisis 12893 --show-prompt     # print the prompt, run nothing
run_anakrisis --record 12893          # afterwards: what the maintainers did
run_anakrisis --list                  # what has been reviewed, and what came back
```

The protocol the review follows — what a review must carry, the block it is
written in, and what *nothing to say* means — is [`review.md`](review.md). The
record is [`ledger/`](ledger/). The plan is [`TODO.md`](TODO.md).

## Status

**Started 2026-09-01**, by an explicit human instruction, which is the only way
one of these may begin.

`run_anakrisis --delta` and `--baseline` both work and have been run. The two
limits above were found by running the first: it compared the two reports with
`diff`, and most of what came back was line numbers moving. Nothing else exists
— no pull request has been reviewed in either arm, the ledger is empty, and the
review protocol in [`review.md`](review.md) is a first guess written before a
single review, which is exactly the condition under which a format is wrong.

There are three endings and a person picks: it graduates into its own
repository, it is folded into the parent, or it is retired in place with a note
saying what was learned. Going quiet is not one of them.

**Owed elsewhere, and not ours to make.** The ecosystem's name register lives in
anoieu, and adding a line to somebody else's register is a person's edit. The
entry this project would take: *anakrisis — ἀνάκρισις, the preliminary
examination before trial: what a change does to the completeness inventory
before it lands. A child project, in dokimasia.*
