# anakrisis — the plan

One thing is built. This is the order the rest would go in, so that a reader can
tell what is intended from what exists.

## First

- [x] **`run_anakrisis --delta`** — the computed half. Two runs of the parent's
      analyses, at the merge base and at the head, subtracted. About 2.5s on a
      cvc5 checkout, no build, one detached worktree that is removed on any
      exit.
- [x] **Make the subtraction mean something.** The first version compared the
      two reports with `diff` and returned mostly line numbers moving and lists
      in an unstable order. It is now a set difference over lines with `:NNN`
      normalised away, which is the only reason the output is readable.
- [x] **[`review.md`](review.md)** — what a review may claim, the four labels,
      the block, and the sealed jar.
- [x] **`--baseline`** — the control arm: the same review with the delta
      withheld. The baseline for this task is
      [`check_cvc5_issue`](../../scripts/prompts/check_cvc5_issue), which is
      prompt-based tooling with no instrument and already produces useful work,
      so what has to be shown is that the delta adds something rather than that
      an assistant can review a diff.
- [ ] **Review one real pull request end to end, in both arms.** Nothing about
      the format above has met a change somebody actually proposed, and a
      protocol designed before its first case is wrong in ways no amount of
      thinking finds. Run both arms on it: one review with no control is an
      anecdote about an assistant, not evidence about a delta.
- [ ] **Then throw the format away and write it again.** Not *revise* — the
      first one is a guess and should be treated as one.
- [ ] **Decide what an unattributable delta line costs.** Today the review keeps
      it and says so. If most lines turn out to be unattributable, the delta is
      noise with a good story and this project should say so rather than tune
      the presentation.

## Then

- [ ] Enough cases to answer the charter's third goal: which review lines were
      acted on, which were noise, and what distinguished them.
- [ ] A held-out set of merged pull requests, picked before any measurement, so
      that *is a review wanted* can be answered against changes nobody chose
      with the answer in mind.
- [ ] **Say whether the empty delta can be trusted.** It is the commonest output
      and the least examined one. The honest test is to run the delta over a set
      of merged changes that *did* touch proof production and count how many it
      was silent about.

## Not yet

- **A machine format out of the parent.** The delta is a diff of prose because
  that is what the parent prints, and both of the limits in the
  [charter](README.md#the-two-limits-named-before-the-first-use) come from it.
  A structured output would fix them — and building one is the parent's
  decision, not this project's, taken when somebody asks for the thing the
  charter names as its wishue rather than because a child project would like it.
  This entry exists so the evidence is written down where the parent's
  maintainer can find it.
- **An index of open pull requests.** The sibling project here keeps one for
  issues and it earns its place, because picking which issue to work is the hard
  part. Picking which pull request to examine is not: run the delta on the one
  you were going to review anyway — it costs two seconds — and let it tell you
  whether there is anything to say. An index would be a second thing to keep
  true for no gain.
- **Sweeping every open pull request.** It needs each one fetched, which is a
  network call, and it would produce a queue of reviews nobody asked for. If the
  wishue ever lands, cvc5's own CI is where a sweep belongs.
- **Anything that posts.** No comment, no review, no approval — see the charter
  and [`pr-policy.md`](../../docs/pr-policy.md). The artifact is a file here.
